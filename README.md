# EmotionalAnalysisCNN
I developed three machine learning algorithms to perform emotional analysis across three different media: text (messages), audio (speech), and video (facial expressions). The neural network will classify media into one of eight different emotions, ranging from joy to sadness to anger. This project won a first place award at the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science.
